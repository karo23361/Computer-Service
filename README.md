# Computer-Service
School project made in APEX using PL/SQL. The goal of my project was to build a Computer Service app that serves both clients and service workers. Additionally, statistics were added to the Admin panel. I used advanced techniques such as procedures, functions, and triggers. All of the project was made in Polish language.
